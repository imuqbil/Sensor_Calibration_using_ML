## Tactile Sensor Calibration using ML  
**Project's description.**: Calibrating the sensors physically is a time consuming process, especially for a distributed sensor with many measurements. In this project, I attempt to use ML to calibrate the sensors.<br />

**Data**: There is two catagories of data.<br />
1- The refrence data obtained from Nano 1.5/1.5, a 6-axis force/torque (F/T) sensor from BL Autotech.<br />
2- The real-life data measured from the companys'sensors that needs to be calibrated.<br />
